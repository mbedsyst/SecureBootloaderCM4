# Secure Bootloader for Cortex-M4
Developing a Secure Bootloader application designed to load multiple firmware applications stored in the internal flash memory based on user selection or a default boot mode. The bootloader includes robust firmware update functionality, verifying and validating application code integrity using CRC-32 checksums. Additionally, working on implementing mechanisms to detect firmware updates stored on an external SD card and ensuring their integrity using SHA-256 verification.
